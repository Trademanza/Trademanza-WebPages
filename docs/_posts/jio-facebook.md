# RIL shares rose by more than 10% after Facebook announces its investment of $ 5.7 billion in Jio Platform Limited (JPL) for 9.99% stake
After Facebook announced its entry into the board of JPL on 22nd April 2020, RIL stocks rose by more than 10% in a single day, adding close to INR 80,000 Cr to market capitalization. The deal valuates Reliance Jio enterprise at INR 4.62 lakh Cr.  
Because of the [Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen), the core business of RIL has taken a hit as [the WTI crude](https://github.com/gauravkumar28/TrademanzaWebPages/blob/master/docs/glossaries/wti.html)â€™s May futures plunged into the negative territory. At the current scenario, analysts evaluate RIL excluding Reliance Jio at INR 4.28 lakh Cr, which makes JPL bigger than the rest of RIL.
JPL is just behind HDFC bank in market value at the moment. 

Are we seeing an IPO coming after the globe recovers from this pandemic?
